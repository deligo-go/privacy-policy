This Privacy Policy describes how Cafe Aura (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when individuals use the Cafe Aura mobile application and related services on campus (the “App”). By using the App, individuals agree to the practices described here.</p> <h2>What this app does</h2> <p>Cafe Aura enables students on campus to browse menu items, place orders online, and pick up items physically from the cafe. There are no delivery partners; all orders are for on‑premise pickup only.</p> <h2>Developer contact</h2> <p>Developer/Operator: Cafe Aura</p> <p>Email: vishwadharan.r@gmail.com</p> <p>Phone: +91 9659008000</p> <h2>Information we collect</h2> <p>We only collect data needed to operate the App and fulfil on‑premise pickup orders:</p> <ul> <li>Account and contact details: name, campus email address, and optionally phone number (for account creation, sign‑in, and order notifications).</li> <li>Order details: items ordered, order notes (e.g., “no sugar”), order timestamps, and pickup status.</li> <li>Campus affiliation (optional): student ID or department, if provided to enable campus eligibility checks or student pricing.</li> <li>Device and usage data: basic diagnostics such as app version, device model, crash logs, and coarse analytics (e.g., screens viewed) to improve app functionality.</li> </ul> <h2>Sensitive data</h2> <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories (e.g., health, precise location, contacts, SMS, call logs, photos/videos). The App does not request access to the device’s contacts, SMS, or call history. We do not collect payment card numbers unless payment is enabled within the App (see “Payments” below).</p> <h2>Location</h2> <p>The App does not collect precise GPS location. If enabled, we may infer approximate location solely to confirm on‑campus usage (e.g., via network info) without storing precise coordinates.</p> <h2>How we use information</h2> <ul> <li>Core functionality: account creation, authentication, showing menu, placing and managing pickup orders.</li> <li>Notifications: sending order confirmations, readiness alerts, and important service messages.</li> <li>Customer support: responding to inquiries and troubleshooting issues.</li> <li>App improvement and security: diagnostics, analytics, and fraud or abuse prevention.</li> </ul> <h2>Data sharing</h2> <ul> <li>No third‑party delivery partners: orders are fulfilled on campus; no delivery data is shared.</li> <li>Service providers: we may use trusted vendors (e.g., cloud hosting, crash reporting, analytics limited to app performance) bound by contractual confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li> <li>Legal: we may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li> </ul> <h2>Payments</h2> <p>If in‑app payments are enabled, processing is handled by a PCI‑compliant payment gateway. Payment instruments (e.g., card numbers, UPI PINs) are processed by the gateway and are not stored on our servers. We retain transaction references and non‑sensitive metadata for receipts and reconciliation.</p> <h2>Advertising</h2> <p>The App does not include third‑party advertising SDKs. We do not sell personal information or share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising.</p> <h2>Children</h2> <p>The App is intended for campus students and staff. It is not directed to children under 13. If a parent or guardian believes a child has provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.</p> <h2>Data retention</h2> <ul> <li>Account data: retained while the account remains active.</li> <li>Orders and receipts: retained as required for accounting, audit, and legal obligations, then securely deleted or anonymized.</li> <li>Diagnostics: retained for a limited period necessary for troubleshooting and service improvement.</li> </ul> <h2>Data security</h2> <ul> <li>Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and restricted access to production systems.</li> <li>Least‑privilege access, periodic reviews, and secure development practices.</li> <li>Vendor due diligence and data processing agreements with service providers.</li> </ul> <h2>User controls and rights</h2> <ul> <li>Access and correction: request a copy of account data or corrections via the contact provided.</li> <li>Deletion: request account deletion; upon verification, we will delete personal data unless retention is required by law or legitimate interests (e.g., financial records).</li> <li>Consent and permissions: where runtime permissions are used, consent can be withdrawn by disabling the permission in device settings; some features may stop working.</li> </ul> <h2>International data</h2> <p>If data is processed or stored outside the user’s region, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual clauses) to protect personal data in accordance with applicable law.</p> <h2>Changes to this policy</h2> <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be highlighted by updating the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, by additional in‑app notice.</p> <h2>Contact</h2> <p>For privacy requests or questions, contact: <a href="mailto:vishwadharan.r@gmail.com">vishwadharan.r@gmail.com</a> or call +91 9659008000.</p> <hr /> <small>Note: This policy is designed to align with Google Play’s User Data requirements and the Data Safety section disclosures. Ensure it remains consistent with the actual data flows in the App.</small> </body> </html>
